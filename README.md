Repo for the 2021-06 GOTO Trifork Academy "API Design" Masterclass 

### Class Prep
We'll be working on exercises and class assignments throughout the sessions. We'll be using mostly online services. However, two utilities that will come in handy during the course are `curl` and `asd`. There will be time for step-by-step install during the class.

### API Stories
You'll find a list of sample stories in the [stories](stories/) folder. You'll also find a template [API Story Builder](stories/api-story-builder.md). 

### API Diagrams
Sample API Diagrams are in the [diagrams](diagrams/) folder. These were created using the http://websequencediagrams.com web app. You can also use https://sequencediagram.org/ to create online WSD files.

_**NOTE: There are some help documents for using WSD here: https://www.websequencediagrams.com/examples.html**_

### Assignment
This course has an overnight assignment. The [README](assignment/README.md) lists the details. We'll expand on them throughout the first day of the course, too.

### ALPS Description
Sample Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) documents are in the [ALPS](alps/) folder.
